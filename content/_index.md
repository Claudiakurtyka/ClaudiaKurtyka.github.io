<p> I am a UI/UX Designer with background in Architectural Technology and Interior Architecture. 
  </p>

<p> 
My fascination with user interfaces led me to dive headfirst into self-guided learning and online tutorials. This self driven pursuit culminated in a role as a UI/UX Designer at a software development company, where I have the privilege of spearheading the design of a transformative B2B mobile application.

<p> 
Through meticulous attention to detail, empathetic user-centred design principles, and a commitment to seamless functionality, I strive to create interfaces that not only captivate aesthetically but also elevate user experiences to new heights. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of design, fusing my architectural background with cutting-edge digital solutions.
